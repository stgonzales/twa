# Ticket Web App

Created By: Stephen Goncalves

Status: In Progress ðŸ™Œ

Type: Project Kickoff ðŸš€

# Overview

I based this project on a gap found in the response and customer service process. The proposal brought here is to classify open tickets by priority of response depending on the term defined by each type of customer.
Let's say we have customers 'A', 'B' and 'C'. Customer 'A' has a response time of 48 hours, 'B' for 24 hours and 'C' for 12 hours. Customer 'A' has an open ticket and 11 hours left to expire, and customer 'C' opens a ticket. So basically this app comes to regulate the priority of response that the analyst must follow because customer 'A' term is the shortest in this scenario. 

### Problem Statement

  - Customers being answered more quickly than they should. 
  - No control of SLA
  - No tool to generate reports 
  - No structured ticket
  - Plenty of gaps for flaws
  - No user delegation and performance control.
